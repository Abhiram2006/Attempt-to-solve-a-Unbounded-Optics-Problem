This problem involved the image of a cube, however, the code failed because the thickness of the cube is 0 for the maxima, which the code didnt take in bounds and we got weird graphs.

This code is essentially a 4 equation solver, it gives a solution within 1% range but the graphs had weird jumps. This is because, the equations can be solved by hand and we get a trivial solution of the cube actually being an infinite plane cuz it had a non-zero finite volume.
